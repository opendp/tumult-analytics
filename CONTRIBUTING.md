## Local development

### Installation

We use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management during development. To set up your environment, install `uv` by following its [installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then install the prerequisites listed in the [Tumult Analytics installation instructions](https://opendp.github.io/tumult-docs/analytics/latest/installation.html#prerequisites), and finally install our dev dependencies by running `uv sync` from the root of this repository.

To minimize compatibility issues, doing development on the oldest supported Python minor version (currently 3.9) is strongly recommended.
If you are using `uv` to manage your Python installations, running `uv sync` without an existing virtual environment should automatically install and use an appropriate Python version.

### Basic usage

You can then locally run our linters and tests by running:
```bash
make lint
make test
```
from the repository root directory.

Note that some operating systems, including macOS, include versions of `make` that are too old to run this project's [Makefile](./Makefile) correctly. macOS users should [install a newer version of make using Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make#default).

Behind the scenes, these commands use the `uv` environment, and rely on [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/index.html) for test automation. You can get a bit more fine-grained control and access additional tools by running nox commands directly (see [this tutorial](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/tutorial.html)). You can find a list of available nox sessions using `uv run nox --list`, then run one of these sessions using e.g. `uv run nox -s test-fast`.

### Testing

Our unit tests are run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html). You can run smaller subsets of tests by using pytest directly. For example, to check tests in a particular test file, run:

```bash
uv run pytest test/unit/a_test_file.py
```

You can also filter to specific tests or specific groups of tests using [pytest filters](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html#specifying-which-tests-to-run). We tag all of our longest-running tests with the `slow` tag, so they can be skipped easily when you want faster feedback (though make sure they pass before you submit!):

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Documentation

The documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), and relies on [autosummary](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosummary.html) to generate the API reference.

To build the documentation locally, run:
```bash
make docs
```
the generated HTML pages are available in the `public` directory.

Note that our API reference is manually organized, and does not follow the internal package structure. If you add a new public class or method to Tumult Analytics, add it to an `autosummary` directive in the relevant `.rst` file under `doc/reference`.

### Cleanup

Running linters, tests, or building docs tends to generate a lot of files in the repository that you generally don't want to keep around. Simply run `make clean` to get rid of all those. This is particularly useful when working on the documentation; Sphinx tends to get confused by files generated in previous documentation builds.

## Final thoughts

We want to actively encourage contributions and help you merge your bug fixes or new features. Please don't hesitate to ask us for help on [Slack][slack] if you encounter any difficulty during the process!
